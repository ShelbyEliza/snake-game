## How to play:

1. Select your board size.
2. Select your difficulty level.
3. Smash the start button.
4. Use the arrow keys to direct your snake head to the yummy snake kibble, but remember never eat your own ever growing tail!
5. The game is over whenever you either have as many snake segments as tiles on the board or whenever you run into yourself.

**This is not a game of self control but of a steady hand and patience. Good Luck!**
